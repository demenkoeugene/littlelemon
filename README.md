# Little Lemon Food Ordering App

This is my final project for the iOS Capstone by Meta course, which is to create a food ordering app for Little Lemon restaurant. 
It displays a list of dishes available for ordering. Users can also customise it by enabling filters to show only certain categories 
of food or using the search function to find food by name. The images below show how the app looks like.
