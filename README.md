# Little Lemon Food Ordering App

My final project for the iOS Capstone by Meta course is to create a food ordering app for Little Lemon restaurant. 
It displays a list of dishes available for ordering. Users can also customize it by enabling filters to show only specific food categories or using the search function to find food by name. The images below show what the app looks like.

# Little Lemon. Release V 2.0.0

I decided to continue developing the project after completing the course and practicing the new skills I had acquired.

# Features of V 2.0.0 release
So in this version, I learned how to use the Firebase platform.
What I have disassembled and implemented
<ul>
     <li>Connecting libraries and dependencies using **Cocoa Pods** and The **Swift Package Manage**</li>
     <li>Implementing authentication using **FirebaseAuth.** Implementation of login via **Email** and **Google Auth**.</li>
     <li>Adding the functions "**forgot password**", "**delete account**", and "**log out**". As well as storing **profile photos**</li>
     <li>Ð¡lose work with **Firestore.** Adding the "table reservation" feature from previous projects. Implemented the function of saving the entered data to the **Firestore NoSQL document database**, **displaying** it in the view, and **canceling** the reservation.</li>
     <li>Also writing a very simple unit test.</li>
     <li>During the development, I learned more about how **the data flow works** in SwiftUI. Also, work with network requests. I used asynchronous in the code</li>
</ul>

# Features
<ul>
     <li>I created a registration screen where the user is prompted to enter their personal data and added animation for a more impressive effect</li>
     <li>Flat navigation, which allows users to interact with the app more conveniently, and stacked navigation to the description of dishes.</li>
     <li>The main screen, contains the title, hero section, menu section, and dish list section.</li>
     <li>The profile screen displays the user's personal data and settings that apply to the entire application.</li>
     <li>It is also possible to save changes on the profile screen, which are held when the application is restarted.</li>
     <li>I also used the <b>Core Data framework</b>. I made a network call to get this data from the URL. After receiving this data, I saved it using the framework.</li>
</ul>
