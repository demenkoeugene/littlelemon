# Little Lemon Food Ordering App

This is my final project for the iOS Capstone by Meta course, which is to create a food ordering app for Little Lemon restaurant. 
It displays a list of dishes available for ordering. Users can also customize it by enabling filters to show only certain categories 
of food or using the search function to find food by name. The images below show what the app looks like.

# Features
<ul>
     <li>I created a registration screen where the user is prompted to enter their personal data and added animation for a more impressive effect</li>
     <li>Flat navigation, which allows users to interact with the app more conveniently, and stacked navigation to the description of dishes.</li>
     <li>The main screen, contains the title, hero section, menu section, and dish list section.</li>
     <li>The profile screen displays the user's personal data and settings that apply to the entire application.</li>
     <li>It is also possible to save changes on the profile screen, which are held when the application is restarted.</li>
     <li>I also used the <b>Core Data framework</b>. I made a network call to get this data from the URL. After receiving this data, I saved it using the framework.</li>
</ul>
